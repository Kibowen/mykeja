# My Keja

This is a web application for managing apartment buildings, called My Keja.

## Introduction

My Keja is a CRM that allows landlords to manage all their buildings, caretakers to keep track of requests and post announcements, and tenants to connect to their caretaker and make small deposits for their rent until they get to the full amount by the end of the month. A system that makes everything easier for landlord, caretaker and tenant.
